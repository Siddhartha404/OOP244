In this workshop, I've gained a solid understanding of fundamental OOP concepts. I've learned that OOP revolves around the ideas of objects and classes. Objects represent discrete units of information, while classes group objects with similar structures and behaviors. Abstraction is a crucial concept in programming, simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding less critical details, which is applied in OOP through objects. Classes, described using standard naming conventions, define the common structure and behavior for objects within them. Encapsulation, a core OOP principle, ensures high cohesion within classes while maintaining low coupling with clients by hiding implementation details. Inheritance allows one class to inherit the structure of another, promoting code reuse, while polymorphism enables multiple implementations for a single interface, reducing code redundancy. These principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism constitute the backbone of OOP, enabling modular, maintainable, and extensible software development.
